# Spark_Word_Extraction
This is the project for the Paper 1 and Paper 2. (Paper2 is under review. If you use this code ,please site.)

rdd_read_docx_v_2021_10_11.py    :Reading docx files with Spark, See Algorithm 1 in Paper 1.

rdd_read_obj_FPFH.py		 :Extracting FPFH features from 3D models, which is included in Paper2.	

rdd_read_images_tackle_zip_files.py  :Extracting image features from images, which is included in Paper2 with compression schema.	


rdd_read_docx_single_node_local_file_shm_with_tika.py : Reading with tika

python_read_image_compress_to_128M.py  :Extracting image features from images, which is included in Paper2 with compression schema. And each zip file is 128M Byte.

*.sh is the shell command to run different test for our algorithm.
